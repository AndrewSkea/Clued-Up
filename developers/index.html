						<h1>Clued Up, and why you should choose our game</h1>
						<p>We obviously want you to select our game, but we have many genuine reasons why it will be simple for you to get along with our software even if you haven't used Unity yourself.</p>
                        <p>TLDR;</p>
                        <ul style="color:white">
                        	<li>We tell you what to edit if you need pointers</li>
                        	<li>Our code is layed out sensibly, and heavily documented</li>
                            <li>Don't let 3D models scare you off, Adobe Fuse (free) gives you access to them within 30 seconds of drag and drop action</li>

										<h3>WE'VE ALREADY DONE THE WORK FOR YOU</h3>
										<p>For assessment 3 our code will need to be extended, and doing this with a shoddy project is a bad idea.</p>
                                        <p>As a helping hand, we have outlines simple methods of extending our code if you choose our project so that less time is spent tryin to work out what happens where. If that is not enough, we will happily help you understand what each of the scripts does, and what happend in the Unity Editor vs the scripts if you are unfamilliar with Unity.</p>
                                        <strong><p>How to do assessment 3:</p></strong>
                                        <ol>
                                        	<li>
                                            	<strong><p>Scoring:</p></strong>
                                                <p>Scoring can easily be implemented by storing Time.time when RoomController.Start() is called (only when with roomIndex = 0) into a new property of Story, and having another new property of Story contain the total of all time faults. The current score could then be calculated at any time based on a function that uses the current Time.time and the start time stored in Story to work out total time playing, and the deductable points. </p>
                                          	</li>
                                       	</ol>

									<h3>WE WILL GIVE YOU EVERYTHING</h3>
									<p>We have saved all the original Photoshop background files, character models and diagrams that we will give you if you choose our project.</p>
                                    <p>This means if there are any changes you ever need to make to assets in our game, you will have access to the original production projects. [Provided you have the correct software - namely Photoshop, Adobe Fuse (free), and StarUML (free)].

								<h2><i>"Definately the best graphics of any of the SEPR games</i> - anonymous SEPR demonstrator</h2>
								<p>One big advantage of using unity is how easy graphics are... Lighting is done through a GUI, animations are drag and drop, and movement of our detectives is done through graphical state machines.</p>
                                <p>Assessment 3 requires that you add more characters to the mix, which (if you want to continue the appearence of Clued Up) will require you to make 3D models.</p>
                                <p>THEY TAKE LITERALLY LIKE 5 MINUTES</p>
                                <p>^ not joking. Adobe Fuse (free) is a drag and drop 3D model maker that exports to Mixamo (free) for rigging and downloading for unity. This process is super super simple and it guides you along, and simple tutorial exist if you cannot understand what to do (I didn't need them tbh).</p>
                                <p>Importing them to unity is simple too, but if you choose our project I will help you add an idle animation to them so they dont just look like a starfish. This can easily be done, and you could probably also work it out if you don't want my help.</p>
