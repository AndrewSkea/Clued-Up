$Did you know ]?
£] you say?
£Ah, a great shame, what happened to them
£I only wish I got to know them before... well.

#Aggressive
$Tell me what you know about this [.
£Ah yes, the legendary [.
£It is rumoured that if you gather enough of them...
£...Then go to the marble wall of destiny...
£...Then focus your gaze on the bottom left brick...
£...One can uncover the secrets of their foes.
$(You get the feeling this was a massive waste of time.)
#Rude
$What's this [?
£Ah, yes, the legendary [.
£I know nothing about it.
#Friendly
$Hey, do you know anything about this [?
£While I am a great wizard...
£It shames me to say that I know not of this [.
#Calm
$Could you tell me about this [?
£Though I may be a great wizard, I know nothing of detail of that.
#Comedic
$You wouldn't happen to know about this [, would you?
£Ah, the legendary [.
£My powers reveal no details about it.
#Annoying
$Hey, tell me about this [.
£What is there to tell about it?
£My magic reveals nothing.
#Manipulative
$You're a grand wizard, surely you know about this [?
£Well, I may not know anything about that [...
£But perhaps some magic will help.
£HOCUS ALOCUS!
£AMORPHI DEGENOROUS!
£WINGARDIUM KEDAVRA!
£OPEN SEASAME!
£...My magic has revealed nothing.

#Aggressive-whiteHair
$I found this [.
£How peculiar. A single strand of white hair.
£One has to wonder where it came from.
£From who's head was this hair plucked?
£What path did it travel down to reach it's destination?
£I wonder.
#Rude-whiteHair
$Is this your [?
£Ah yes, that would appear to be one of my hair.
£How... peculiar.
#Friendly-whiteHair
$Could this be your [?
£How interesting, I do believe it is.
£I wonder how you could have come across it.
£How... interesting.
#Calm-whiteHair
$Do you recognise this [?
£Ah yes! I do believe that belongs to me!
£A hair from head of my wizardly self.
£How... peculiar.
#Comedic-whiteHair
$I do believe this is your [.
£Ahh, yes, quite. That is indeed my hair.
£But where could you have found it?
£How could hair such as mine come under your possession?
£How... bizzare.
#Annoying-whiteHair
$Hey, is this your [?
£Why yes, yes it is.
£But what has caused me to lose hair so vigorously as this?
£Could it have been ill magic?
£How... bizzare
#Manipulative-whiteHair
$Oh grand wizard, I believe I have found your [.
£Perhaps. Let me use some magic on it to determine this.
£JIGGERY POKERY!
£WALLOBY WANABY!
£CRUCY MAHGOOSEY!
£...My magic has revealed nothing.

#Aggressive-wand
$Is this your [?
£Ah yes... a wand...
£A wand is a powerful magical instrument.
£A wizard would be very foolish to leave this lying around.
£Tell me, do you have any proof that this belongs to me?
$Well you are the only wizard here.
£A well deduced fact.
£Truly you are a... great... detective.
#Rude-wand
$I presume this is your [.
£A wand you say?
£Eleven inches, mahogany, phoenix core...
£Why yes, this is my wand.
£How good it is to be reuinited again.
#Friendly-wand
$Did you drop this [?
£A wand? Why, I am missing mine. Let me...
£Mmm hmm... yes... quite....
£Yes, this does appear to be my wand.
#Calm-wand
$Would this be your [?
£It very well may be. Let me have a closer look...
£Ahh... yes quite... Indeed...
£This is, in fact, my wand.
#Comedic-wand
$So this would be your [, then?
£Perhaps. If I may take a... closer look....
£Eleven inches, mahogany, phoenix core...
£This is indeed my wand.
#Annoying-wand
$This is your [, right?
£Ah yes, I do believe it is.
£But how has it come under your possession, I wonder?
£Truly, a great mystery.
#Manipulative-wand
$Oh great wizard, could this be your [?
£Perhaps. Some magic shall be able to reveal all.
£BANANA CABANA!
£APATHY DANETY!
£OMMLETTE DU FROMAGE!
£...My magic has revealed nothing.

#Aggressive-cloak
$Is this your [?
£Ah, a magic cloak of invisibility!
£Look at the way it shimmers in your hands.
£How it tries to hide everything behind it from sight.
£It is so very... interesting.
#Rude-cloak
$Is this your [, old man?
£Ah yes, this would be my [.
£But please, do not reffer to me as old.
£I may be 102 but I still have plenty of life left in me!
#Friendly-cloak
$Did you drop this [?
£Ah yes, that is in fact my [.
£That is the trouble with [s, you see.
£If they are misplaced, it is not in their nature to be found.
#Calm-cloak
$Could this be your [?
£A [, you say?
£As a matter of fact, I do recognise it.
£I believe this to be mine, handed down from my father.
£It is a very powerful cloak.
£Do take care of it, won't you?
#Comedic-cloak
$Did you not see that you dropped this [?
£An amusing play of words, but I must confess I didn't.
£It must have slipped fromy britches without my knowledge.
#Annoying-cloak
$So this is your [, right?
£Ah yes, I do believe it is.
£Thank you for locating it.
#Manipulative-cloak
$Oh great wizard, I believe I have come in possession of your [.
£Ah, yes, my [!
£This reminds me of the tale of the Deadly Hollows.
£Would you me to tell you this tale?
$Well, actually I-
£Wonderful! Let us begin!
£Three friends were attempting to cross a bridge at dusk.
£Or was it dawn? I can never remember.
£Regardless, their names were Simon, Miguel and Tony.
£Wait... or perhaps it was Toby?
£They were attempting to cross the river...
$(You decide to sneak away.)

#Aggressive-wizzardHat
$This is your [, right?
£Ah, that would appear to be a hat belonging to a wizard.
£And I, as a wizard, should have a wizard's hat.
£Apparently, however, these hats have become something of a fashion accessory.
£Commonly worn on a November evening with a pumpkin.
£How very quaint.
#Rude-wizzardHat
$Hey, is this your [?
£Ah, why yes it is!
£I may have lost it during the night.
£I appreciate its safe return.
#Friendly-wizzardHat
$Did you drop this [?
£Ah, why yes I did!
£It must have slipped off my head during the night.
£I understand you need it for the investigation.
£But I trust you will keep it safe.
#Calm-wizzardHat
$Does this [ belong to you?
£Ah, I do recognise it.
£Yes, I do believe it is mine.
£Do take care of it for me, won't you?
#Comedic-wizzardHat
$I think old age is catching up with you, you dropped this [.
£Ah, so I have.
£I must have dropped it last night, unfortunately.
£Time catches up with all of us, unfortunately.
#Annoying-wizzardHat
$So this is your [, right?
£Ah yes, I do belive it is.
£I must have misplaced it last night.
£Thank you for locating it for me.
#Manipulative-wizzardHat
$Oh great wizard, I have located your [.
£While that may appear to be the case, I don't believe that hat is mine.
£You see, that hat is rather crooked, whereas my hat is straight.
£Perhaps I can straighten it with some magic.
£SPOOKIUS DOOTIUS!
£ALAKA ZAMAKA!
£MAGIC WORDS!
£...My magic appears to have had no effect.

#Aggressive-ticket
$Is this your [?
£What is this you possess? A train ticket?
£Ah, imagine all of the places one could go with such a ticket!
£One could concievably go anywhere in the country!
£It's a shame none of the trains are stopping here today.
£I do fancy a trip to the beach.
#Rude-ticket
$This is your [, then?
£Ah yes, I did have a ticket for the train.
£I would have flown in by broom, but I didn't think the weather would allow it.
£Fortunately, the train was available.
#Friendly-ticket
$I think you dropped this [.
£Ah yes, I did. Thank you.
£I would have flown in on my pegasus, Griffa.
£Unfortunately, he currently has a sprained wing.
£I thought the journey here would have been a bit much for him.
£Thankfully, I have a very friendly giant taking care of him for me.
#Calm-ticket
$Did you happen to drop this [?
£Ah, yes I did. Thank you for finding it for me.
£I would have used my Staff of Teleportation to teleport here...
£But alas, it teleported away and I have yet to relocate it.
£Thankfully, the trains here are reliable.
#Comedic-ticket
$A [? Why would a wizard need a train?
£Well you see, I had not intended to use the train.
£Initially, I had wanted to come here on my magical boat.
£Then I realised that the Ron Cooke Hub had no dock.
£So I took the train instead.
#Annoying-ticket
$This is your [, yes?
£Ah, I do believe it is.
£Initially I had wanted to travel here by the Choo network.
£Then I discovered that there was no real fireplace here.
£As warm as those newfangled electric fireplaces are...
£One cannot safely teleport inside of them.
£So I was forced to take the train isntead.
#Manipulative-ticket
$Oh great wizard, I have come in possession of your [.
£This... could be my ticket.
£To determine this, I shall have to use a magic spell.
£WITTY DITTY!
£COLUMBO DUMBO!
£SPELL WORDS!
£...My magic has revealed nothing.

#Aggressive-coal
$I assume this [ has something to do with you.
£Ah, a lump of coal.
£Coal has many uses.
£For instance, one can use it as a projectile.
£Many a pane of glass has been shattered by a lump of coal.
£It also makes a great Yule gift, if memory serves.
#Rude-coal
$Why have I found some [?
£Ah yes, I did have some coal on me.
£Coal is a great magical component.
£If you ever consider becoming a wizard, I would purchase some.
#Friendly-coal
$Would this happen to be your [?
£Ah yes, I was wondering where I put my coal.
£Thank you for finding it for me.
£Coal has some very useful magical properties.
£I always try to carry some on me.
#Calm-coal
$You wouldn't happen to know what this [ is, would you?
£Ah yes, that is my lump of coal!
£It is a requirement for many of my magical spells.
£Coal is a very useful material to have.
#Comedic-coal
$A lump of coal? Someone wasn't good for Santa...
£Who is this Santa you speak of?
£That lump of coal is a powerful magical focus.
£It is crucial in the correct performance of many magical spells.
£Is this Santa a wizard?
£Or a witch, perhaps?
#Annoying-coal
$Is this your [?
$Why, yes it is!
$Every good magician has coal on their person.
$Sadly, I did appear to have misplaced mine.
$Perhaps it is best if we do not speak of this further.
#Manipulative-coal
$Oh great wizard, I appear to have found... a lump of coal?
£Well, let us see what magic I can perform on this coal.
£BAZINGA BAZANGA!
£BAGPUS CATPUS!
£ALAKABLAM!
£...My magic appears to have had no effect.
