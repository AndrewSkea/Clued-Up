#Annoying-brownHair

£It's really rude.
#Manipulative-brownHair
$Surely a comedian as great as yourself isn't losing his hair?
£Aye, it happens to all of us eventually I'm afraid.
£And that is definitely one of mine, no denying it.
£Hopefully I keep what I have left.
£Otherwise I'll look really odd in a nightclub.
