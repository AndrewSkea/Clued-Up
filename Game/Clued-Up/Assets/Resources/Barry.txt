£I can't say I've ever seen that before.
#Rude
$What's this [?
£I 'ave no idea what that is.
#Friendly
$Hey, do you know anything about this [?
£I can't say I do.
£Sorry I can't be of more help.
#Calm
$Could you tell me about this [?
£I don't think I've ever seen it before. Sorry.
#Comedic
$You wouldn't happen to know about this [, would you?
£I... don't recognise it.
£Sorry I can't be of more use.
#Annoying
$Hey, tell me about this [.
£I don't think I can help you there.
#Manipulative
$You're a well-traveled comedian, surely you know about this [?
£You would think that I've seen everything by now, wouldn't you?
£Unfortunately, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
£Sorry.

#Aggressive-brownHair
$Is this one of your hairs?
£Oh, that is one of my hairs.
£Where did you find that?
#Rude-brownHair
$This is one of your hairs, right?
£It looks like one of mine at any rate.
£Where did you find it?
#Friendly-brownHair
$I think I've found one of your hairs.
£Oh, that's definitely one of mine.
£Must've fallen out somewhere.
£Where did you find it?
#Calm-brownHair
$This looks like one of your hairs, what do you think?
£Yeah, that does look like one of mine, doesn't it?
£No clue where you would have found it.
#Comedic-brownHair
$I think you need a hair net, I just found this lying around.
£Yeah, I would stick to being a detective.
£Leave the comedy to the professionals.
£But that does look like one of my hairs, doesn't it?
£This entire murder business has left me hanging on by a thread!
$...
£...Oh come on, that was funny.
#Annoying-brownHair
$This is your hair, right?
£Listen, I don't know who brought you up...
£But you can't just go around asking people if you have their hair.
£It's really rude.
#Manipulative-brownHair
$Surely a comedian as great as yourself isn't losing his hair?
£Aye, it happens to all of us eventually I'm afraid.
£And that is definitely one of mine, no denying it.
£Hopefully I keep what I have left.
£Otherwise I'll look really odd in a nightclub.

#Aggressive-moustache
$I think you dropped this [.
£Oh yeah, I did. Thanks.
£It's for a comedy routine.
£Do you want to see?
$....No.
#Rude-moustache
$Can you not leave your moustaches lying around?
£Oh, sorry. I must have dropped it in rehearsal.
£Thanks for finding it, by the way.
£If I'd lost it the new routine would be ruined!
#Friendly-moustache
$Did you drop this [?
£Oh yes, this is mine.
£I thought I was missing something.
£Must've fallen out when I was rehearsing the new comedy routine.
£Thanks for finding it, the routine would have been ruined without it.
#Calm-moustache
$Did you happen to drop a [?
£I... oh yes, I did!
£Thank you, I didn't even realise I had dropped it!
£It's part of a new comedy routine, you see.
£I'm trying to get back onto TV.
£As fun as Chirper is, I do miss the old days.
#Comedic-moustache
$I didn't know you were growing a moustache!
£Ah, well that's the trick, you see.
£You just need somebody else to grow the moustache for you.
£Then you can just shave it off and use it in stand up comedy!
#Annoying-moustache
$This is what constitutes comedy? Fake moustaches?
£Listen, if you want to heckle me you can do it on Chirper.
£Right now there's a murderer on the loose.
£And you're stood here complaining about my new comedy routine!
#Manipulative-moustache
$This moustache must be for a new routine, right?
£Ah, you catch on quickly!
£Yeah, I'm working on some new material right now.
£I'm trying to get back on TV with this one.
£Hopefully it goes well.

#Aggressive-ladder
$Is this your ladder?
£Ah... yeah, that's my ladder.
£I was using it for... ehrm... climing.
£I was wondering where I'd left it.
£Thanks for finding it for me.
#Rude-ladder
$Why did I find your ladder just lying around?
£My ladder? Oh yeah, my ladder!
£I had forgotten where I had left it.
$Yeah, but why do you have a ladder in the Ron Cooke Hub?
£I was using it to uh... climb. Yeah....
#Friendly-ladder
$Would this happen to be your ladder?
£Ah, yes it would! Thank you!
$Why do you have a ladder in the Ron Cooke Hub?
£I needed it to... climb something.
£I'd rather not say.
#Calm-ladder
$Does this ladder belong to you?
£Yeah, that's my ladder alright.
£I was climbing it earlier, must have forgot to put it away.
$Why were you climbing a ladder in the Ron Cooke Hub?
£I... uh... nevermind.
#Comedic-ladder
$How many Chortle brothers does it take to change a lightbulb?
£Two. You get the bulb and you spin it to me to you to me to you.
$Is there a ladder in this scenario?
£...Oh, you found my ladder!
£Yeah, I was using it earlier, not for changing a lightbulb though.
$What were you using it for?
£I... can't say.
#Annoying-ladder
$So does modern comedy involve stepladders now?
£You wouldn't know comedy if it slapped you in the face with a salmon.
£Now do me a favour and go away.
#Manipulative-ladder
$What would a great comedian need with a ladder?
£Well, physical comedy comes in many forms.
£This ladder isn't physical comedy, though.
£I was using it because I needed to get to... well...
£I'd rather not say.

#Aggressive-ticket
$This is your ticket?
£Oh, you found my train ticket!
£I need that to get home! Thanks!
#Rude-ticket
$Did you lose your train ticket?
£Hm? Oh, you found my ticket!
£Thanks, I need that to get home!
#Friendly-ticket
$I think I've found your train ticket.
£Ah, yeah that's definitely my ticket.
£I wouldn't be able to get home without it. Thanks!
#Calm-ticket
$I do believe this is your ticket.
£Oh yeah, thank you! I thought I had lost it!
£If I didn't find it I don't think I'd have been able to get home.
#Comedic-ticket
$So this is your... ticket to ride?
£Listen, you're a good detective.
£I'd stick with that, not comedy.
£But yeah, that is my train ticket.
£I'm glad you found it, I need it to get home.
#Annoying-ticket
$A train ticket? Is comedy in that much of a dire state?
£Listen, the train is a great mode of transport.
£It's quick, easy, and gets you there in one piece.
£Which is what you won't be in if you don't stop bugging me.
#Manipulative-ticket
$Hey, I think I have your train ticket...
£Oh, yes, that is my ticket!
£Thanks for finding it, I thought I had lost it!
£I didn't know how I was going to get home without it.

#Accuse-NoItems
$You did it!
£...
£...Oh, I get it, you're trying to be a comedian!
£Yeah, sorry mate, that wasn't very good.
£Usually jokes have a punchline.
#Accuse-WrongChar
$You did it!
£...Alright, I admit it!
£Yes, I did rig that charity race last month!
£I just wanted to get one over on Paul, that's it!
$...
£...Oh, you thought I did the murder.
£No, that wasn't me, I'm afraid.
#Accuse-Motive
$You did it!
£Well, that's certainly something.
£Surely you have some reason as to why I would do such a thing?
£...No? Ok then.
#Accuse-Weapon
$You did it!
£Really? I did?
£What did I do it with?
$....
£...Ok then, never mind.
#Accuse-Right
$You did it!
£...Well then.
£This is a bit of a sticky wicket.
£But unfortunately for you, I have an escape plan!
£Activate the EMERGENCY LADDER!
£TO ME!
£...
£...This worked a lot better when I had Paul.
